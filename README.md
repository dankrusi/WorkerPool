# WorkerPool
A very light-weight, simple worker pool utility class for running tasks in a queue model. Auto-scaling is automatic, where additional worker threads are added as the queue grows, or removed as the queue size decreases. This class is thread-safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment.
